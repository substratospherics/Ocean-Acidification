      <article>
        <p>
          An increase in the acidity of the ocean is known as ocean
          acidification. This can have huge impacts on marine organisms as the
          concentration of carbonic acid in seawater gets higher and the pH
          decreases, making the water more acidic. This change in pH can alter
          the physiology, behavior, and ecology of many marine organisms in
          several ways, which we will cover on this website.

      <h1>1. Calcifying Organisms</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is used by oceanic calcifying organisms like
          corals, mollusks, and some planktonic species to construct and
          preserve their exoskeletons. When calcium ions (Ca2+) and carbonate
          ions (CO32-) combine in seawater, a mineral called calcium carbonate
          is created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many chemical processes take place throughout the calcification
          process. In order to create calcium carbonate, calcium ions and
          carbonate ions in seawater must first interact. The concentration of
          calcium and carbonate ions in the seawater, which is regulated by
          elements including temperature, salinity, and CO2 levels, is a
          prerequisite for this reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, more carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules mix with water molecules
          to create carbonic acid (H2CO3) as the amount of CO2 in the ocean
          rises. The concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decreases as a
          result of the increase in acidity, making it more challenging for
          calcifying organisms to produce their calcium carbonate structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dissociation of calcium carbonate into its component ions as a
          result of the pH drop further limits the amount of carbonate ions
          available to calcifying organisms. Dissolution is the process
          involved, and it has the potential to weaken and erode existing
          calcium carbonate formations in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, a variety of environmental conditions, such as
          temperature, salinity, and the concentration of CO2 in the water, have
          an impact on the chemistry of calcification. The chemistry of
          calcification is disturbed as ocean CO2 concentrations rise, making it
          harder for calcifying species to construct and maintain their
          structures, which can have a big influence on marine ecosystems.

          A small marine creature called a pteropod, sometimes known as a "sea
          butterfly," is roughly the size of a small pea. Pteropods are a source
          of food for young salmon in the North Pacific and are consumed by
          creatures of all sizes, from small krill to whales. The images above
          demonstrate how a pteropod's shell dissolves in sea water over the
          course of 45 days at pH and carbonate levels that are predicted for
          the year 2100.

      <h1>2. Non-calcifying Organisms</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          Fish and some types of algae in the water are non-calcifying creatures
          and do not require calcium carbonate for structural support, but they
          are nevertheless sensitive to pH fluctuations. As the amount of CO2 in
          the ocean rises, carbonic acid is created, which lowers the pH of the
          seawater and increases its acidity. The chemistry of the seawater is
          impacted by this pH variation, which may have an effect on the
          physiology and behavior of marine species.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ion balance in the cells of marine species can change when the
          acidity rises. The hydrogen ions (H+) from carbonic acid, in
          particular, have the ability to impair the normal operation of
          proteins, enzymes, and other cellular functions. This may result in a
          slowed metabolism, slower growth, and a compromised immune system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the intake of nutrients by marine species may be
          impacted by the acidity of seawater. For instance, the growth and
          reproduction of some species of algae and plankton depend on the
          presence of dissolved nutrients like nitrate and phosphate. The
          availability of essential nutrients may decrease with an increase in
          acidity, making it more challenging for these organisms to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behavior of marine species can also be impacted by the acidity of
          saltwater. According to certain research, certain fish species' sense
          of smell can be affected by an increase in acidity, making it harder
          for them to find food and avoid predators.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, the rise in ocean CO2 and the resulting acidification can
          have a variety of effects on the physiology, behavior, and ecology of
          non-calcifying organisms. Depending on the species and the particular
          environmental circumstances, the precise effects may vary, but the
          overall tendency is toward harming marine ecosystems.

      <h1>3. Effects on the Food Web</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          Ocean acidification's effects on species distribution, abundance, and
          interspecies interactions are referred to as "food web effects" in the
          ocean. Ocean acidification-related modifications to the physiology and
          behavior of calcifying and non-calcifying organisms may indirectly
          affect the food web.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, the disappearance of calcifying organisms, such as
          corals and mollusks, may result in less food being available for other
          species that depend on them. This can include tiny herbivores that
          nibble on the algae that develops on the shell's surface or larger
          predators that eat the organisms directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the ocean's nutrition cycle may be impacted by the
          decline in calcifying organisms. Calcium carbonate shells give
          bacteria a surface on which to develop and create biofilms, which are
          crucial for the cycling of nutrients. The availability of these
          biofilms and the nutrients they hold may decline when these shells
          dissolve as a result of ocean acidification, affecting the entire food
          web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the range and number of non-calcifying organisms can be impacted
          by ocean acidification. For instance, several studies have
          demonstrated that a rise in acidity can alter the behavior of some
          fish species, resulting in decreased activity levels and a decreased
          capacity to locate prey or evade predators.The loss of important
          predator or prey species can have a ripple effect on the environment,
          which can affect the entire food web.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a whole, it might be challenging to forecast how ocean
          acidification will affect the food chain because these effects are
          complicated. However, it is evident that modifications in the ocean's
          chemistry brought on by an increase in CO2 can have major indirect
          effects on species distribution, abundance, and interactions,
          ultimately affecting the entire marine ecosystem.

          Like we've said earlier, pteropods, also known as "sea butterflies,"
          are tiny marine animals. Pteropods are a significant source of food
          for young salmon in the North Pacific and are consumed by creatures
          ranging in size from tiny krill to whales. The images above
          demonstrate what happens to a pteropod's shell when it comes into
          contact with excessively acidic seawater. A shell from a live pteropod
          that was found in the Southern Ocean in an area with moderate acidity
          is depicted in the left panel. The pteropod shell on the right was
          found in an area with increased acidity.
